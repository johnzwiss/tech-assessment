To run application:  

fork and clone to terminal  

cd into tech-assessment directory  

run `node script.js`  

if you do not have node, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/  

During this process, I learned to plan and account for edge cases. The last verse of this song has different words, so I needed to create an if statement to handle the edge case.  


I am proud of how I was able to readily come up with a solution. I feel like I quickly knew exactly what I needed to and I was able to finish the assessment accurately and quickly. I am also glad that I thought of the edge case, checkedout to a dev branch, commented my code, and wrote cleanly.  


## Scenario Two 

Me: I am happy to help! Could you please provide me with the error message you are seeing? It should be in blue at the top of the page. 

Thanks! 

Heather: Hmm.. I am not seeing anything in blue. It's telling me my email address is already registered. I usually just login automatically, and I am not sure what is going on. 

Me: That is odd. We don't have that error set up on our login page. Could you tell me what the form says at the top? Or, better yet, could you copy and paste the URL from the top of the page? 

Heather: It says join as talent, and here is the URL https://themomproject.com/mom/signup?redirect_after=%2Fmom

Me: Okay, I see what is happening now. You are trying to log in using the sign up page. Please click the log in button in the top right and then enter your email and password. Or, you could use this link right here. https://themomproject.com/mom/login?redirect_after=%2Fmom 

Please let me know if this doesn't fix your issue. 

Heather: That was it! Thank you for your help! 

Me: No problem at all, I am glad we could figure this out together. Have a wonderful day!
