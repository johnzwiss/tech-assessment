During this process, I learned to plan and account for edge cases. The last verse of this song has different words, so I needed to create an if statement to handle the edge case.  


I am proud of how I was able to readily come up with a solution. I feel like I quickly knew exactly what I needed to and I was able to finish the assessment accurately and quickly. I am also glad that I thought of the edge case, checkedout to a dev branch, commented my code, and wrote cleanly.
